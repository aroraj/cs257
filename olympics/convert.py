#Step 1
#Design a database to represent the data from the Kaggle CSV files. 
#Write your design in the form of CREATE TABLE statements, and save those statements 
#(and only the CREATE TABLE statements, including semi-colons) in a text file called olympics-schema.sql.

#Step 2
#read the Kaggle CSV files and write one CSV file 
#for each of the of the tables in your database design.

# If you have designed a table named "athletes", for example, 
# the corresponding CSV file should be named "athletes.csv", and should have the same columns as the table.

#Step 3
#Add each of your new CSV files to your repository.
#(You may, if you wish, also add the original Kaggle files to your repository. 
#But it's not necessary. That athlete_events.csv file is kind of a beast at 30MB, 
#and you may prefer to just link to the originals at the top of convert.py or something like that.)

#Step 4
#Write SQL queries in queries.sql
